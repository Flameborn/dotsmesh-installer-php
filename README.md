# Dots Mesh Installer

Creates and configures a [Dots Mesh server](https://github.com/dotsmesh/dotsmesh-server-app/) for your domain, so you can create public profiles and groups. Installs the [Dots Mesh web app](https://github.com/dotsmesh/dotsmesh-web-app/) too, as an alternative to the official one at [dotsmesh.com](https://dotsmesh.com/).

## Requirements
- A web server (Apache, NGINX, etc.)
- PHP 7.2+
- A domain starting with "dotsmesh." (dotsmesh.example.com)
- SSL/TLS certificate

## How to use

Just visit [about.dotsmesh.com/self-host](https://about.dotsmesh.com/self-host/) and download the installer PHP file. Then upload it to your server and run it in a browser.
